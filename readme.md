# jQ Bootstrap-style Dropdowns#

This is a fork of Jquery Drop down . The prmary disadvantage with Jquery dropdown is that it overrides the bootstrap default dropdowns. Hence if you have used exitsing drop downs in your website all of them will be rendered useless. 

I have modified it to not do so. I have also added animations. The long term plan is to make it into an angular directove as well.

All the features mentioned here are working in this too. The main change is that it adds a class .jq-dropdown and has animation while showing and hiding teh dropwdown
